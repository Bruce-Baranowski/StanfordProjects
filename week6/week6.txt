1a:
	name == "Q" is incorrect, as it's comparing reference rather than content 
	name.equals("Q") would fit better for string comparison
	
2a:
	((ch == 'Q') && (name.length() == 1))
	will properly check the string is equal to Q, 
	only takes one comparison on a string that has an incorrect first character,
	and only takes two comparisons on other strings.
	
	However, this code will throw an exception if fed a string of zero length.
